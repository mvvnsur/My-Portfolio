    <h1>Hi, my name is Mansur. I'm Web-developer</h1>
    <h4 class="about__text my-3">If you are visiting this website it means that you interested in me and my work. Let me tell you about myself.
      I started learn programming in 2020, when I was at university. Then suddenly I had a break for one and half year, because of some reasons.
      But now I'm back! <br> <br> At the moment I have been learning JavaScript for one year and also Vue JS framework. 
      <br> <br> You can see my all skills in 'Skills' page on the navigation! Nice to see you and good luck!
